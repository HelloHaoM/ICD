In this assignment, we have use serval strategies to ensure that our work is correct and focus on the critical problem.

1.Requirements Analysis
The specification of the assignment is a little bit longer, so at first, we read the specification separately in order to have a brief overview of the system. Then, we talk together to find out key functions that are needed to apply. All of functions should be agreed with both of us. In addition, if there are some conflict between us, we will ask other people to give us some advices. 

2.Paired Programming
In order to make sure the code correctly, we work together at one workstation. One is a driver to write code directly and the other is an observer to review each line of code. It really helps us to improve the quality of the code and reduce the number of bugs when we are coding. And the role we have changed frequently to make sure we have enough attention on our work. 

3.Code Reviews
In addition to paired programming, we also have reviewed our code separately after finishing each task to ensure there are no mistakes existing. In the process of paired programming, some bugs can be occurred because both of us are on the wrong track. When we review all the code and test it later, it is easier to find bugs with sober mind.
